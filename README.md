# r/Sethesda_Submissions bot


If I'm being quite honest with you, I'm quite surprised this bot even works. It was a really weird adventure of failed Unit Tests and Crippling depression. Then I just borrowed some code from my earlier projects. It works now. Not sure what line made it work and which line(s) are redundant. However, I'm not bold enough to find out, so I'm just leaving it.
